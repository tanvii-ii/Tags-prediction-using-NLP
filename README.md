### Tags-prediction-using-NLP

#### The project aims to classify and predict the tags of given blogs/discussions threads. The developer community has evolved extensively, and we notice a wide use of this through websites like Stack Overflow, medium etc. Since the contributions to such communities is large, the amount of content generated is huge too. We proposed to systemize these blogs by sorting them according to their respective topic of discussions which can be done by predicting the tag for each blog/discussion.
